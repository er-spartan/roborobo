# WEEK 10: Factory Arm Bot

## Coding Concept

Assembling and programming a complex structure of servos, then coding the desired functionality

## Key Insight

Planning before you build, harmonizing your hardware design with your intended functionality. Must have a working model for how the code relates to the robot, guessing and checking will no longer work

## Description

Make a robot arm that can pass along crates using a claw, discuss how servos and code allows us to automate production processes
